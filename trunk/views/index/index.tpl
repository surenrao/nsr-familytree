<p>Hi!! This is the <BIG><B>Main</B></BIG> page, I am trying to make it more cool
comparing to my first website. I will make it more fundu with time.I have added my college
photos, and links to cool sites in fun and timepass with bizarre and mythology stuff.
Actually this site is dedicated to my family tree which is about 300 years old
(can you believe it!!). You can find information about every possible Nyayapati on earth here.
I have also added my family photos. Finally if you have some suggestions for my site please mail me.
My latest Addon is <b>Message Board</b>. Thanks for coming <br><I>Suren</I></p>
